## Usage
Visit [the search engine](https://book-search-n-save-graphql.herokuapp.com/) and, upon arrival, either create an account or log in if you have already created an account. 

Then, once logged in, you may search for books using the search bar before clicking the "Save This Book" button beneath the book you want to save. To see your currently saved books, visit the navigation bar and click on "See Your Books." 

Once this page loads, you can view your saved books or remove a book from your to-be-read list by clicking the "Delete this Book!" button beneath the book in question. 

Users can log out at any time (assuming they are logged in) by clicking on "Logout" in the navigation bar.
